# Garmino Project

Garmino is a pet project that showcases my skills in web development. The project consists of a dynamic tab creation feature written in JavaScript, with the tab content coming from a JSON database. It also includes a slider that I built using native JavaScript, form validation, and email sending using PHPMailer. In addition, modal windows have been added to enhance user experience.

## Features

### Dynamic Tab Creation

The dynamic tab creation feature allows to create new tabs on the fly, with the content for each tab being populated from a JSON database. This feature was implemented using JavaScript.

### Slider

I built the slider for this project using native JavaScript. The slider can be used to display images or other content in a responsive and visually appealing way.

### Form Validation and Email Sending

To ensure that the user enters valid information, the form has been validated using JavaScript. Once the user submits the form, the data is sent to a PHP script that uses PHPMailer to send an email to the specified email address.

### Modal Windows

Modal windows have been added to enhance user experience. These windows can be used to display additional information or to confirm an action before proceeding.

## Conclusion

Overall, Garmino is a great project that showcases my skills in web development. It demonstrates my ability to work with dynamic content, create visually appealing features, and ensure that user input is valid.
